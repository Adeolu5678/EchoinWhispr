# Non-Functional Requirements for React Native Application

AI Agent, implement the React Native application strictly adhering to the following non-functional requirements from SSD Section 4, applying React Native and Expo-specific best practices.

4.1. Performance
4.1.1. UI Responsiveness (60 FPS):
Directive: Minimize expensive operations in render methods of React Native components.
Techniques:
Utilize React.memo, useCallback, useMemo hooks effectively to prevent unnecessary component re-renders.
Employ FlatList for all scrollable lists, leveraging getItemLayout and windowSize props for optimal performance.
Avoid complex calculations directly within render functions.
Ensure animations (if any) use Animated API or react-native-reanimated for native driver-based performance.
4.1.2. Application Load Time (Max 3s Cold Start):
Directive: Optimize initial bundle size and startup sequence.
Techniques:
Leverage Expo's build optimizations (e.g., tree-shaking).
Avoid importing large libraries or components that are not immediately needed on startup.
Optimize asset loading (images, fonts) using expo-font and expo-asset where applicable.
Ensure minimal data fetching on the initial root screen to speed up time-to-interactive.
4.1.3. Network Latency (Max 200ms):
Directive: Optimize data fetching and real-time updates.
Techniques:
Efficiently use Convex's useQuery hooks for real-time data, subscribing only to necessary data.
Implement optimistic UI updates for actions like sending a whisper to provide immediate feedback to the user, even before backend confirmation.
Minimize redundant network requests.

4.2. Scalability
Directive: Adhere strictly to the Modular Architecture (Section 1.1) to ensure components and features can be developed and scaled independently.
Techniques: Follow best practices for large-scale React Native applications, including clear module interfaces and minimal inter-module dependencies. Rely on Convex and Clerk for backend scalability.

4.3. Security
4.3.1. Authentication & Authorization:
Directive: Implement Clerk SDK correctly. Ensure all Convex data interactions pass through securely defined API functions with appropriate authorization checks based on ctx.auth.userId.
Techniques: Never store sensitive user data (e.g., raw passwords, API keys) locally in plain text. Use secure storage for Clerk tokens as provided by the SDK.
4.3.2. Data in Transit:
Directive: All communication between the React Native client, Clerk, and Convex must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.
Techniques: Always use https for API endpoints.
4.3.3. Input Validation:
Directive: Implement both client-side and server-side (Convex) input validation for all user inputs.
Techniques: Use form validation libraries (e.g., react-hook-form with Zod schema) for client-side feedback. Crucially, Convex mutations must include v.string(), v.id(), v.object() for rigorous server-side validation.

4.4. Usability (1-minute first whisper)
Directive: Design an intuitive flow for core actions.
Techniques:
Provide clear, immediate visual feedback for user actions (loading indicators, success/error toasts).
Ensure large, easily tappable touch targets for all interactive elements (buttons, icons).
Use clear and consistent iconography.
Implement Expo Router for a smooth and predictable navigation experience.

4.5. Maintainability
Directive: Prioritize clean, well-structured, and easily understandable code.
Techniques:
Clean Code: Write concise, readable TypeScript code. Avoid deeply nested components and excessive inline styling.
Comments: Provide clear and comprehensive comments for complex logic, functions, component purpose, and any non-obvious implementations.
Type Safety: Consistently use TypeScript for all components, hooks, services, data models, and Convex function parameters/return types.
Modularity: Adhere strictly to the src/features modular structure.
Code Formatting: Configure and apply ESLint and Prettier.
Consistent Styling: Use Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind) consistently across the application.

4.6. Reliability
Directive: The application must function correctly under various conditions, including network fluctuations.
Techniques:
Robust Error Handling: Implement try-catch blocks for all API calls and potentially error-prone operations.
Graceful Degradation: Display user-friendly messages for network errors or offline states. Re-establish connections and re-fetch data transparently upon network recovery.
Edge Case Handling: Consider and implement handling for empty states, loading states, and invalid data inputs.
