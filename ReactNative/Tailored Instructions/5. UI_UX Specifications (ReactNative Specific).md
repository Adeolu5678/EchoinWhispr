# React Native UI/UX Specifications

AI Agent, ensure the React Native application's UI/UX strictly adheres to the design philosophy and component usage.

5.1. Design Philosophy
Minimalist & Clean: Maintain a clean layout, avoiding visual clutter.
Mobile-First: Optimized for touch interaction and smaller screens.
Consistent Look & Feel: Align with the web application's aesthetic where possible, but prioritize native mobile interaction patterns.
Modern Aesthetic: Use rounded corners for elements, subtle shadows (where appropriate via Tailwind), and clear typography.

5.2. Core UI Elements & Styling
Color Palette & Typography: Configure Tailwind CSS in tailwind.config.js to define the color palette. Use the "Inter" font family (ensure it's loaded using expo-font) for all text.
Buttons: Use TouchableOpacity or Button components, styled with Tailwind classes, for all interactive buttons. Ensure adequate touch target size.
Input Fields: Use TextInput components, styled with Tailwind classes, for all text inputs. Provide clear labels and placeholder text.
Navigation: Implement a bottom tab navigator (using Expo Router's tab group) for primary navigation (e.g., Home/Inbox, Compose Whisper, Profile). Utilize a stack navigator for secondary screens (e.g., whisper detail if implemented later).
Icons: Use a consistent icon library (e.g., Ionicons from @expo/vector-icons).

5.3. Responsive Design
Fluid Layouts: Use React Native's Flexbox properties and Tailwind's responsive utility classes (w-full, h-full, percentages) to create layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.
Density-Independent Pixels (dp): All sizing (dimensions, padding, margin, font sizes) should use density-independent pixels for consistent visual size across devices.
Safe Area Insets: Use SafeAreaView (from react-native-safe-area-context if necessary) to properly handle device safe areas on iOS and Android.
No Horizontal Scrolling: The layout must never exhibit horizontal scrolling on any screen size or orientation.
Image Optimization: Use expo-image or Image components with proper resizeMode and consider image optimization techniques to ensure fast loading and display on various devices.
