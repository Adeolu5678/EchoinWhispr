# Development Workflow & AI Interaction

AI Agent, your work will be guided by the "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow defined in SSD Section 8.
Prompt Adherence: Your generated code must directly address the requirements in the provided prompt. If the prompt is ambiguous or incomplete, provide clarifying questions in your response.
Modularity: Place generated code in the appropriate feature modules (e.g., features/authentication, features/whispers).
TypeScript: All generated code must be in TypeScript, including explicit types for props, state, and function arguments/return values.
Comments: Include concise, high-quality comments explaining complex logic, component purpose, and any non-obvious implementations.
Self-Correction: If you identify potential issues in your generated code (e.g., performance, security, better React Native patterns), highlight them and suggest improvements or provide alternative solutions in your output.
Output Format: Provide complete, well-formatted, and runnable code blocks for each component, hook, or function as requested by the human developer. Ensure imports are correct and all dependencies are declared in package.json where applicable.
No alert() or confirm(): Never use alert() or confirm() in the generated code. Use custom modal components or toast notifications for user feedback.
