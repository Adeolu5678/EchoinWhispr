# Project Setup & Initialization

AI Agent, your first and most critical task is to establish the foundational project structure for the ReactNative application.

1.1. Directory Structure
Create a new React Native project using the Expo CLI (npx create-expo-app) inside the EchoinWhispr/ReactNative folder. Ensure the project is initialized with TypeScript. The folder structure within ReactNative/src must strictly adhere to the Modular Architecture (Feature-Based) specified in SSD Section 2.4.1.

    ├── app.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── babel.config.js
    ├── tailwind.config.js          # For Tailwind CSS integration (e.g., using NativeWind)

1.2. Technology Stack Configuration
Configure the following technologies within the ReactNative project.
Expo: Ensure app.json and app.config.ts are correctly configured for the Expo managed workflow.
React Native: Standard React Native setup.
TypeScript: Enable strict type checking in tsconfig.json. All components, hooks, utilities, and data models must be strongly typed. Define interfaces for props, state, and API responses.
Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind): Integrate NativeWind (or a similar compatible solution) to enable Tailwind CSS utility classes in React Native components. Configure tailwind.config.js with a basic color palette, typography settings, and ensure it works for styling components.
PNPM: Ensure package.json is configured for PNPM. Use pnpm install and pnpm start with Expo.
Convex:
Initialize the Convex client SDK for React Native.
The shared Convex/schema.ts from the monorepo root will be used for schema definition.
Define Convex queries and mutations in shared Convex/functions.ts for user management (create, find) and whisper management (send, fetch, mark read).
Configure Convex client setup in lib/convex.ts or similar, ensuring it can connect to your Convex deployment.
Clerk:
Install and configure Clerk's React Native/Expo SDK.
Wrap the root of the application with ClerkProvider.
Implement redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated states using useAuth and useRouter from Expo Router.
Expo Router: Configure file-based routing with authenticated and unauthenticated route groups as shown in the directory structure.
