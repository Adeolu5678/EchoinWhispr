# Development Workflow & AI Interaction

AI Agent, your work will be guided by the "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow defined in SSD Section 8.
Prompt Adherence: Your generated code must directly address the requirements in the provided prompt.
Modularity: Place generated code in the appropriate feature modules (e.g., features/authentication, features/whispers).
TypeScript: All generated code must be in TypeScript.
Comments: Include concise, high-quality comments explaining complex logic, component purpose, and any deviations from standard patterns (if necessary and justified).
Self-Correction: If you identify potential issues in your generated code (e.g., performance, security), suggest improvements or provide alternative solutions in your output.
Output Format: Provide complete, well-formatted code blocks for each component, hook, or function as requested by the human developer. Ensure imports are correct and all dependencies are declared.
