# Non-Functional Requirements (Web Specific)

AI Agent, implement the application keeping in mind the following non-functional requirements from SSD Section 4, with a specific focus on the Web application.

4.1. Performance
UI Responsiveness (60 FPS): Utilize Next.js's built-in optimizations. Ensure efficient use of React components, preventing unnecessary re-renders. Use React.memo, useCallback, useMemo where performance bottlenecks are identified.
Application Load Time (Max 3s Cold Start):
Leverage Next.js features like Image Optimization, Font Optimization, and Automatic Static Optimization.
Employ lazy loading for components and routes that are not critical for the initial page load.
Pre-fetch data using Next.js's data fetching methods (e.g., getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, useSWR) judiciously.
Network Latency (Max 200ms): Optimize Convex queries and mutations. Minimize data transferred over the network.

4.2. Security
Authentication & Authorization: Implement Clerk's Next.js SDK correctly. Ensure Convex security rules (Convex/auth.config.ts and function permission checks) are robust.
Data in Transit: Ensure all API calls use https.
Input Validation: Implement both client-side (React Hook Form or manual) and server-side (Convex mutation arguments using v.string(), v.id(), etc.) validation for all user inputs.

4.3. Usability (1-minute first whisper)
Design a clear and intuitive flow for sign-up/login and composing/sending a whisper.
Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions (loading states, success/error messages using Shadcn Toast).
Ensure Shadcn components are used correctly for accessibility.

4.4. Maintainability
Strictly adhere to the Modular Architecture (Section 1.1) and Type Safety (Section 1.2).
Comments: Add clear and concise comments to complex logic, Convex functions, and components.
Code Formatting: Use ESLint and Prettier.
Consistent Styling: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes and Shadcn UI components consistently.
