# UI/UX Specifications (Web Specific)

AI Agent, ensure the web application's UI/UX strictly adheres to the design philosophy and component usage.

5.1. Design Philosophy
Minimalist & Clean: Maintain a clean layout, avoiding visual clutter.
Consistent Look & Feel: Align with the mobile application's aesthetic.
Modern Aesthetic: Use rounded corners for elements, subtle shadows (where appropriate via Tailwind), and clear typography.

5.2. Core UI Elements & Styling
Color Palette & Typography: Use Tailwind CSS to configure the color palette and enforce the "Inter" font family.
Buttons: Utilize Shadcn Button components for all interactive buttons. Customize with Tailwind to match the defined styles.
Input Fields: Utilize Shadcn Input and Textarea components for all text inputs.
Navigation: Implement a clear header for global navigation (e.g., app logo, user avatar/status).

5.3. Responsive Design
Fluid Layouts: Use Tailwind's responsive utility classes extensively (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) to ensure the layout, spacing, and font sizes adapt gracefully across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
No Horizontal Scrolling: The layout must never exhibit horizontal scrolling on any screen size.
Next.js Image Optimization: Use the next/image component for all images to ensure they are optimized for different screen densities and sizes.
