These foundational assumptions, based on our discussions, govern all subsequent design decisions.
Generous Freemium Model: The core loop is designed for user acquisition and habit-forming.
Free: Create persona, search/browse, receive Whispers, and send unlimited replies.
Paywall: Free users are limited to initiating 5 new "Whispers" (new conversations) per day.
Premium: A subscription unlocks unlimited daily new Whispers.
"Whisper Request" Inbox: To manage new conversations and prevent spam, the inbox is bifurcated.
"Requests" Tab: All new, incoming Whispers land here. A user must "Accept" a request.
"Chats" Tab: All "Accepted" conversations and ongoing replies live here.
MVP Scope: "Block" functionality is out of scope for MVP. A user can ignore a request by simply not accepting it.
Managing Decentralization (Syncing): We will use explicit loading states to manage user expectations during decentralized data synchronization (per HCS and client-side search).
Inbox Sync: "Please, wait while your messages are being updated..."
Search Sync: "Syncing user directory..."
