# Part V: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

## 5.1. Security & Privacy

- **Data Protection:** All user data in transit must be encrypted via TLS.
- **Authentication:** All private routes must be protected via Clerk middleware.
- **Authorization:** Convex Row Level Security (RLS) or equivalent logic must ensure users can only access their own data or public profile data.
- **Anonymity:** While the backend knows the user identity (via Clerk), the frontend must strictly enforce anonymity by never displaying real names or contact info, only the "Persona".

## 5.2. Performance & Scalability

- **Real-time Latency:** Message delivery should appear instantaneous (< 100ms) using Convex's WebSocket-based subscription model.
- **Database Indexing:** Queries for "Mood Match" and "Search" must be optimized with proper database indexes to handle thousands of users.
- **Asset Optimization:** Images must be optimized (compressed/resized) before storage or upon retrieval to ensure fast load times.

## 5.3. Usability & Accessibility (UX)

- **Modern UI:** The interface should be "Premium" and "App-like", utilizing smooth transitions and responsive design.
- **Feedback:** Immediate visual feedback for all actions (sending messages, updating profile).
- **Accessibility:** The app should follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines (contrast, keyboard navigation).

## 5.4. Reliability

- **Uptime:** Rely on Convex and Vercel's high availability infrastructure (99.9% SLA).
- **Data Integrity:** Convex's transactional guarantees ensure no partial updates or data corruption.
