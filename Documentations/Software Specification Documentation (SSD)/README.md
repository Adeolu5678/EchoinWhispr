# Software Specification Documentation (SSD) for EchoinWhispr

This directory contains the comprehensive Software Specification Document (SSD) for the EchoinWhispr dApp, a fully decentralized social application on Hedera for anonymous persona-based connections.

## Document Structure

The SSD is organized into the following parts:

1. **Introduction & Overview** - Project vision, core value proposition, user personas, and use cases.
2. **System Architecture and Design** - Decentralized stack blueprint, on-chain vs. off-chain data strategy, and technology stack.
3. **Data Models & Smart Contract Specification** - On-chain data models, complete Solidity contract, and off-chain encrypted content structures.
4. **Detailed Functional Workflows** - Step-by-step workflows for anonymous conversations with rich media support.
5. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** - Security, performance, usability, cost efficiency, and decentralization requirements.
6. **External Interfaces and Dependencies** - Hedera network services, decentralized storage, and client-side libraries.
7. **Glossary of Terms** - Definitions of key terms and concepts used throughout the documentation.

## Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized:** Serverless architecture using Hedera's suite of services with no central servers.
- **Anonymous Persona-Based Networking:** Merit-based connections through career, interests, and mood matching.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Conversations:** Two-way messaging with rich media support, encrypted client-side.
- **Trust by Design:** Immutable smart contracts govern all interactions transparently.
- **Web3-Web2 Bridge:** Familiar UX with powerful decentralized privacy features.
- **Target Users:** Web3 echo chamber users, Web2 intimidated users, real-world wall users.

## Version History

- **v1.0:** Initial draft based on foundational research and features.
- **v1.1:** Incorporated user feedback; deferred "Romance Pillar" to post-MVP.
- **v1.2:** Added rich media (image) support to anonymous conversation workflow.
