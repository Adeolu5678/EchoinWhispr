# UI/UX Specifications

The UI/UX design for both the Web and ReactNative applications will align with a modern, minimalist, and intuitive mobile-first philosophy, ensuring a consistent and pleasant user experience across platforms.

5.1. Design Philosophy
Minimalist & Clean: Emphasize simplicity, clarity, and focus on essential content and interactions. Avoid visual clutter to promote user focus.
Mobile-First Design: The design process will prioritize the mobile experience, scaling up for larger screens (tablets, desktops) rather than scaling down.
Consistent Look & Feel: While respecting native platform conventions (e.g., iOS vs. Android navigation gestures), a unified brand identity and design language will be maintained across both web and mobile applications.
Modern Aesthetic: Incorporate contemporary design trends such as rounded corners on elements, subtle shadow effects for depth, and a clear, legible typographic hierarchy.
Brand Identity: A consistent color palette and logo (to be provided later) will be applied across all applications.

5.2. Core UI Elements
5.2.1. Color Palette
Requirement: A well-defined color palette for primary actions, secondary elements, backgrounds, text, and states (e.g., success, error) will be established.
Implementation: For Web, these will be configured in tailwind.config.js. For ReactNative, a compatible Tailwind implementation or a custom theme file will define these colors.
Contrast: All text and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards for color contrast.
5.2.2. Typography
Requirement: Use a clear, legible, and aesthetically pleasing font family consistently across all applications.
Font Choice: "Inter" will be the primary font family, unless an alternative is specifically chosen for better mobile performance or brand alignment (e.g., NativeStack, System font).
Hierarchy: Define a consistent set of heading styles (H1, H2, H3) and body text sizes (sm, base, lg) to establish visual hierarchy and readability.
5.2.3. Buttons
Requirement: All interactive buttons will be clearly styled, visually distinct, and provide appropriate feedback on press/hover.
Styles: Define primary, secondary, and tertiary button styles. Buttons will feature rounded corners and sufficient padding for easy touch targets on mobile.
Feedback: Implement visual feedback for states such as pressed/active, disabled, and loading.
5.2.4. Input Fields
Requirement: Text input fields will be clean, accessible, and provide clear visual cues for focus and validation states.
Styles: Define consistent styles for default, focused, error, and disabled states. Include clear labels, placeholder text, and appropriate icons where necessary.
Accessibility: Ensure input fields are properly labeled and navigable for accessibility tools.
5.2.5. Navigation Elements
Requirement: Primary navigation elements will be intuitive and consistent.
Web: Likely a persistent header or sidebar navigation for primary routes.
React Native: A combination of bottom tab navigation for top-level screens (e.g., Home, Compose, Profile) and stack navigation for detail views.

5.3. Navigation Principles
File-Based Routing (Next.js & Expo Router): Both Web and ReactNative applications will utilize file-system-based routing, which promotes clear organization and maintainability.
Intuitive Hierarchy: A logical and predictable flow between screens, allowing users to easily understand their current location, the path they took to get there, and how to navigate back.
Platform Consistency with Adaptability:
Web: Standard browser navigation (back/forward buttons) will function as expected.
React Native: Native navigation gestures (e.g., swipe-back on iOS) will be supported. The Android hardware back button will be handled gracefully for navigation and exiting the app.

5.4. Responsive Design for Mobile (React Native Implicit) & Web
Web Application:
Fluid Layouts: Utilize CSS Flexbox and Grid, along with percentage-based widths and vw/vh units, to create layouts that adapt smoothly to various screen sizes.
Tailwind's Responsive Prefixes: Extensively use responsive utility classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:) to adjust layout, spacing, typography, and visibility at different breakpoints.
Image Optimization: Use responsive image techniques (e.g., srcset, sizes) and Next.js's Image component for optimal performance across devices.
React Native Application:
Adaptive Components: Components will inherently adapt to different device screen sizes and orientations due to React Native's flexible layout system (Flexbox).
Density-Independent Pixels (dp): Utilize dp units for sizing and spacing to ensure consistent visual size across devices with varying pixel densities.
SafeAreaView: Correctly implement SafeAreaView for iOS devices with notches and dynamic islands to prevent UI elements from being obscured.
