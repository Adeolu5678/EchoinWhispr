# Glossary of Terms

AI Agent / Gemini: The Artificial Intelligence model (e.g., Gemini) used to generate code based on detailed prompts provided by the human developer.
Clerk: A third-party authentication service that provides robust user management, sign-up, sign-in, and session control.
Convex: A real-time backend development platform offering a serverless database and API layer.
EchoinWhispr: The overarching name of the application project, encompassing web and mobile platforms.
Expo: A framework and platform built on top of React Native, simplifying cross-platform mobile app development, building, and deployment.
Expo Router: A file-based routing system for React Native and Expo applications, simplifying navigation configuration.
Feature Flag: A software development technique that allows features to be remotely enabled or disabled without deploying new code, used for progressive delivery and experimentation.
Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase (Dart) for mobile, web, and desktop. In this project, it is a personal learning endeavor.
Foundation-First Approach: An architectural strategy where placeholders and underlying structures for future features are built into the initial codebase, enabling easier future integration.
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): The development workflow where a human developer acts as an orchestrator, overseeing, reviewing, and guiding AI agents in code generation.
Kanban: An Agile project management methodology that visualizes workflow using boards and cards to track tasks through various stages.
Lean Development: A methodology focused on maximizing value while minimizing waste, emphasizing rapid delivery of core features.
Live Query: A feature of Convex that automatically pushes real-time updates to connected clients whenever underlying data changes in the database.
Modular Architecture: An architectural style where a codebase is organized into independent, self-contained units (modules), typically aligned with specific features or business capabilities.
MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The version of a new product that includes only the essential features required to satisfy early adopters and gather validated learning.
Next.js: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications, offering features like file-system routing and API routes.
Notion: A versatile workspace application used in this project for comprehensive project management, documentation, and the AI Agent Logbook.
PNPM: A fast, disk-space efficient package manager that supports monorepos by using symlinks and hard links.
Prompt Engineering: The process of carefully designing inputs (prompts) to guide AI models to generate desired outputs, crucial for AI-driven development.
React Native: An open-source UI software framework for developing cross-platform native mobile applications using React.
Requirement ID: A unique identifier assigned to each functional or non-functional requirement for traceability.
Shadcn UI: A collection of re-usable, accessible UI components built using Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS.
SSD (Software Specification Document): A comprehensive document detailing the requirements for a software system, serving as the project's "source of truth."
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces directly in markup.
Traceability Matrix: A conceptual tool used to link requirements to design elements, code, and test cases, ensuring all requirements are addressed and verifiable.
Vercel: A cloud platform providing hosting for frontend applications and serverless functions, optimized for Next.js deployments.
Vibecoding: A term used in this project to refer to the process of generating code primarily through AI agents, with human oversight.
Whisper: An anonymous, one-way text message exchanged within the EchoinWhispr platform, forming the core interaction model.
Window-space: An architectural concept within this project referring to foundational code structures or placeholders implemented for deferred features, making their future integration seamless.
