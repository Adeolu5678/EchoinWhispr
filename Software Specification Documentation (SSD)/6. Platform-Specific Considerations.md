# Platform-Specific Considerations

While the project emphasizes cross-platform development, acknowledging and strategically addressing platform-specific behaviors and optimizations is crucial for delivering a native-quality experience.

6.1. Web Application Considerations (React with Next.js)
Browser Compatibility:
Requirement: The web application must be fully functional and visually consistent across the latest two versions of major evergreen browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari (desktop and mobile), and Microsoft Edge.
Guidance for AI Agents: Adhere to modern web standards. Avoid deprecated features. Use polyfills judiciously if absolutely necessary for broader compatibility.
SEO Optimization:
Requirement: Leverage Next.js's SSR/SSG capabilities for optimal search engine indexing of public content (if any in future).
Guidance for AI Agents: Ensure proper meta tags, semantic HTML, and sitemaps are generated.
Progressive Web App (PWA) Capabilities (Future):
Foundation: Consider incorporating a manifest.json and basic service worker setup for future PWA features (e.g., "Add to Home Screen" functionality).
Feature Flag: PWA_CAPABILITIES (set to false for MVP).

6.2. ReactNative Application Considerations (React Native with Expo)
6.2.1. Android Specifics
Requirement:
Hardware Back Button: Implement consistent handling of the Android hardware back button for navigation (e.g., navigate back in the stack, then exit app if on root).
Permissions Management: Integrate Android-specific permission requests for features like location or push notifications gracefully, adhering to Android's permission dialog best practices.
Performance Optimization: Pay close attention to memory usage and CPU cycles, especially when targeting mid-range Android devices, which often have more constrained resources than flagship iOS devices.
Guidance for AI Agents: Utilize BackHandler from React Native for custom back button behavior. Employ conditional rendering or styling for Android-specific UI elements if design deviates.
6.2.2. iOS Specifics
Requirement:
Safe Area Insets: Correctly handle safe area insets for notched devices (e.g., iPhone X, 12, 13, 14, 15 series) to prevent UI elements from being obscured by the notch or dynamic island.
Native Gestures: Ensure native-like swipe-back gestures are supported where appropriate within the navigation stack for a truly iOS-native feel.
Permissions Management: Integrate iOS-specific permission requests for features like location or push notifications, respecting iOS's user experience guidelines for such prompts.
Guidance for AI Agents: Utilize SafeAreaView component. Implement react-native-gesture-handler for custom gesture support where needed.
6.2.3. Expo Managed Workflow Advantages
Simplified Native Module Integration: Leveraging Expo's extensive SDK (e.g., expo-notifications, expo-location, expo-image-picker) will simplify interaction with native device capabilities, as these modules are pre-configured and managed by Expo. This avoids direct interaction with native code, which is highly beneficial for AI-driven development.
Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates: Expo Application Services (EAS) enable the ability to push code updates directly to users' devices without requiring a new app store submission. This allows for rapid bug fixes and feature enhancements without user intervention.
Development Builds: Expo allows for easy creation and distribution of development builds (expo go), streamlining the testing and iteration process.

6.3. Flutter Application Considerations (Learning Project)
Native Widget System: The Flutter project will utilize its rich set of Material Design (Android) and Cupertino (iOS) widgets to build platform-adaptive UIs.
Platform Channels (Future Learning): If native integration beyond standard plugins is required, the Flutter project will explore Platform Channels for communication between Dart and native code (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS). This will be a specific learning objective.
