# 1.1. Project Overview

The EchoinWhispr project is an innovative platform centered on a unique social interaction model: anonymous one-way messages called "Whispers." These Whispers possess the intriguing potential to evolve into two-way, mutually revealed conversations under specific user-driven conditions. The project aims to deliver a seamless, high-performance, and intuitive user experience across multiple platforms, maximizing user engagement and expanding accessibility.
The core of the project involves the parallel development of two production-ready applications, both operating within a unified backend infrastructure. Additionally, a dedicated learning project will exist for the human developer. The entire project codebase resides within a single Git repository named EchoinWhispr, structured into distinct subfolders:
Web: Contains the codebase for the web application, currently undergoing a complete rebuild using React and Next.js. This application will target modern web browsers across various devices, providing broad accessibility.
ReactNative: Contains the codebase for the primary native mobile application, developed using React Native with the Expo framework. This application will target Android and iOS devices, offering a mobile-first experience. This is the "vibecoded" project where AI agents will be the primary code generators.
Flutter: Contains the codebase for a separate Flutter mobile application. This is explicitly a personal learning project for the human developer and is not part of the primary production build. Its purpose is to serve as a practical challenge to independently re-code the functionality of the vibecoded React Native application, fostering skill development in Flutter/Dart.

1.2. Project Objectives
The overarching objectives for the EchoinWhispr project are:
Deliver a Unified User Experience: Provide a consistent and high-quality user experience across both the web and primary mobile (React Native) applications, ensuring seamless transitions between platforms.
Achieve Core Functionality (MVP): Successfully implement the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for both the web and React Native applications, focusing on secure user authentication and the core sending/receiving of text-based whispers.
Ensure Scalability & Maintainability: Design and build the applications with a modular architecture and foundational "window-spaces" for future features, allowing for easy expansion and long-term maintenance without extensive refactoring.
Leverage AI-Driven Development: Successfully utilize AI agents (Gemini) for code generation in the Web and ReactNative projects under a structured "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow, maximizing development efficiency while maintaining quality.
Robust & Secure Backend: Establish a reliable, real-time, and secure backend infrastructure using Convex and Clerk to support all client applications.

1.3. Scope Definition: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
To ensure rapid development and a focused initial release for both the Web and ReactNative production applications, the MVP is strictly defined as follows:
Secure User Authentication:
User Registration (Sign-Up): Ability for new users to create accounts securely.
User Login: Ability for existing users to log in with their credentials.
Session Management: Secure and persistent user sessions.
Core Messaging: Whispers:
Sending Whispers: Users can compose and send anonymous one-way text messages.
Receiving Whispers: Users can view and interact with whispers sent to them in real-time.
Displaying Whispers: Presentation of whisper content in a clear and readable format.
Explicitly Deferred from MVP: All other functionalities are deferred to subsequent development phases, including:
Conversation evolution (Whisper to Echoed Whisper).
Image uploads (both for whisper content and user profile pictures).
Comprehensive user profile management (beyond basic account setup).
Advanced push notifications (though the foundation will be present).
Location-based features (beyond initial foundational hooks, no admin tracking).

1.4. Target Audience
The primary target audience for EchoinWhispr across all platforms consists of individuals who are introduced to the platform through social recommendations and word-of-mouth. The applications' design will assume a baseline level of tech literacy and familiarity with modern digital communication platforms. The user experience will prioritize intuition and a "nice" feel, as explicit in-app tutorials are minimized under the assumption that users will have a general understanding of the app's unique concept.

1.5. Guiding Principles
Lean Development: Prioritize delivering the highest value features with the minimal necessary effort to achieve a shippable product quickly.
Scalability & Extensibility: Design the architecture to accommodate significant future growth in users and features without necessitating major refactoring.
Maintainability: Ensure the codebase, especially that generated by AI agents, is clean, well-structured, understandable, and easily modifiable.
Consistency: Maintain a unified user experience, design language, and data model across all production applications (Web and React Native).
Security & Privacy: Uphold the highest standards of data security and user privacy. Avoid collecting any sensitive user data unless explicitly required for core functionality and with clear user consent. The previous proposal for admin location/device tracking has been dropped.
AI-Augmented Development: Embrace AI agents as powerful development tools, managed through a structured human-in-the-loop process to ensure quality and control.
