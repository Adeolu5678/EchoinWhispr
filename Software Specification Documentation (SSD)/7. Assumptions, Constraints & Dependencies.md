# Assumptions, Constraints & Dependencies

This section clearly enumerates the critical factors that influence the project's execution, including foundational assumptions, limiting constraints, and external dependencies. These must be understood and managed proactively to ensure project success.

7.1. Assumptions
AI Agent Capability: It is a core assumption that AI agents (specifically Gemini) are sufficiently capable of generating production-quality code for React Native, Next.js, Convex backend functions, and Clerk integrations. This includes adherence to specified architectural patterns (modularity, feature flags), best practices (clean code, TypeScript), and security guidelines based on detailed prompts.
Prompt Engineering Effectiveness: It is assumed that you, as the Human-in-the-Loop developer, possess or will quickly develop the necessary skills in prompt engineering to effectively and unambiguously communicate requirements to the AI agents.
Convex & Clerk Reliability: The stability, performance, scalability, and security of the Convex backend and Clerk authentication services are assumed to be robust and reliable. Adequate monitoring tools will be set up to receive real-time alerts on the status and performance of these third-party services.
Expo Compatibility: Ongoing compatibility of the Expo framework with the latest React Native versions, Android, and iOS operating system updates, and target hardware devices is assumed.
Internet Connectivity: The core functionalities of the application (authentication, sending/receiving whispers) assume active and stable internet connectivity for users. Graceful degradation for temporary network interruptions will be implemented.
Development Environment Stability: It is assumed that the local development environment (including Node.js, PNPM, IDE, etc.) will be maintained in a stable and functional state.

7.2. Constraints
Human-in-the-Loop Bottleneck: Your capacity as the sole human developer for code review, manual testing, integration, debugging, and overall project orchestration will be the primary bottleneck in the development lifecycle.
AI Agent Limitations: AI agents may occasionally produce suboptimal, inefficient, or insecure code, or may misunderstand nuanced requirements. This necessitates thorough human review and correction, which is a significant constraint on development speed.
Learning Curve (Flutter): The Flutter learning project, while valuable for your personal development, represents a self-imposed constraint on the time and resources available for the primary production (Web and ReactNative) applications.
Platform Store Guidelines: Adherence to stringent Apple App Store and Google Play Store guidelines (e.g., UI/UX, privacy, security, content) is mandatory for both React Native app submission and future updates.
Resource Limitations: The project is strictly constrained by a single human resource (you) and the capabilities of AI agents. No additional human developers, dedicated QA personnel, or UI/UX designers are assumed.
Initial Feature Set: The MVP's limited scope is a deliberate constraint to ensure a shippable product, deferring many desired features.

7.3. Dependencies
Convex API: All Web and ReactNative applications are fully dependent on the Convex backend for data storage, real-time updates, server-side logic (queries and mutations), and data synchronization.
Clerk Authentication Service: Both Web and ReactNative applications rely entirely on Clerk for user authentication, authorization, and secure session management.
Expo SDK & Services: The ReactNative mobile application's build process, deployment via EAS, and access to native device features are entirely dependent on the Expo framework and its associated services.
Node.js: Required for running JavaScript environments, package managers, and various development tools.
PNPM: Required for efficient package management across the monorepo.
Development Tools: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with appropriate extensions (e.g., for React, TypeScript, Tailwind), Git client.
Third-Party Libraries: All specific npm/yarn packages used in React/Next.js and React Native/Expo (e.g., Tailwind, Shadcn).
