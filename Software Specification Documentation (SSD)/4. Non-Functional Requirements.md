# Non-Functional Requirements

These define how the EchoinWhispr applications will perform, operate, and be maintained. They are critical for ensuring a high-quality user experience and long-term project viability.

4.1. Performance
4.1.1. UI Responsiveness:
Requirement: The application's user interface (both Web and React Native) must maintain a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS) during animations, scrolling, and all user interactions. Any perceived "jank" or stuttering is unacceptable.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Minimize expensive computations or state updates within React component render (Web) or build (React Native) methods.
Utilize React's performance optimization techniques: React.memo for functional components, useCallback for memoizing functions, and useMemo for memoizing values, to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
For lists with many items, employ virtualized list components (e.g., React.virtualized or react-window for Web, FlatList with getItemLayout and windowSize for React Native) to only render visible items.
Profile component rendering to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
4.1.2. Application Load Time (Cold Start):
Requirement: The application (both Web and React Native) must be fully loaded, authenticated, and ready for user interaction (displaying the main home/inbox screen) within a maximum of 3 seconds on typical network conditions (e.g., 4G mobile, standard broadband Wi-Fi) after a cold start (i.e., first launch or after being completely closed).
Guidance for AI Agents:
Optimize initial bundle size through code splitting and lazy loading of non-critical components.
Prioritize essential data fetching for initial rendering.
Utilize Next.js features for optimal web performance (e.g., image optimization, efficient data fetching strategies).
For React Native, leverage Expo's build optimizations and consider preloading assets.
4.1.3. Network Latency:
Requirement: Core data fetching operations (e.g., retrieving new whispers, sending a whisper, initial user data load) should have a typical latency of less than 200 milliseconds (excluding actual network transmission time) to ensure a near real-time and responsive feel for user interactions. Real-time updates from Convex should reflect changes almost instantaneously (within 50ms for UI reflection).
Guidance for AI Agents:
Efficiently use Convex's real-time query capabilities, subscribing to data rather than polling.
Minimize redundant API calls and optimize query structures within Convex.
Implement optimistic UI updates where appropriate for perceived speed (e.g., showing a whisper as "sent" immediately while awaiting backend confirmation).

4.2. Scalability
Description: The application and its backend infrastructure must be designed to accommodate a growing user base without significant degradation in performance, requiring major architectural overhauls, or excessive manual intervention.
Targets:
Launch: The system must stably support a minimum of 100 concurrent users without noticeable performance degradation.
Growth (6-12 months): The architecture should be capable of scaling to 1,000 concurrent users with minimal adjustments to the application code, primarily relying on the inherent scalability of Convex and Clerk services.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Adhere strictly to the modular, feature-based architecture to allow for independent scaling of components or micro-frontends if needed in the distant future.
Utilize Convex's managed scaling features and optimize Convex database functions for efficiency.
Ensure efficient data structures and query patterns to minimize database load.
Implement client-side caching strategies where appropriate to reduce redundant backend requests.

4.3. Security
Description: The EchoinWhispr applications must rigorously protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and resist common mobile and web vulnerabilities.
4.3.1. Authentication & Authorization:
Requirement: All user authentication will be handled securely by Clerk, leveraging industry-standard practices for secure password hashing, multi-factor authentication (if enabled), token management, and session validation.
Requirement: Access to Convex data will be strictly controlled by Convex's built-in security rules, ensuring users can only read/write data they are explicitly authorized for (e.g., a user can only read whispers addressed to them, or update their own profile).
Guidance for AI Agents:
Implement Clerk SDKs correctly for both Web and React Native. Do not attempt to re-implement authentication logic.
Ensure all Convex data interactions pass through securely defined API functions (queries and mutations) that incorporate robust authorization checks based on the authenticated user's identity (ctx.auth.userId).
Never store sensitive user data (e.g., raw passwords, API keys) client-side or in insecure locations.
4.3.2. Data in Transit:
Requirement: All communication between client applications (Web, React Native), Clerk, and Convex must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.
Guidance for AI Agents: Always ensure API endpoints are accessed via https. Do not allow fallback to HTTP.
4.3.3. Input Validation:
Requirement: The application must perform rigorous server-side (Convex) and client-side (React/React Native) input validation to prevent malicious data injection (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and ensure data integrity and format correctness.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Implement client-side validation for immediate user feedback (e.g., email format, password strength, text length).
Crucially, implement server-side validation within Convex mutations (v.string().length(...), v.id(...), v.object(...) etc.) for all data submitted by clients, as client-side validation can be bypassed.
4.3.4. Backend Security (Convex):
Requirement: The project will rely on Convex's default security measures and best practices for data storage, access control, and API protection.
Guidance for AI Agents: Follow Convex security documentation meticulously when defining functions and data schemas, particularly with regard to indexing and permissions. Regularly review Convex's security guidelines.

4.4. Usability (User Experience - UX)
Description: The application must be intuitive, easy to learn, and provide a pleasant and "nice" overall user experience.
Target: A new user must be able to successfully send their first whisper within one minute of opening the application for the first time (after completing the initial sign-up/login flow).
Guidance for AI Agents:
Clear User Flow: Design straightforward, minimal steps for core tasks (sign-up, login, compose whisper, view whispers). Avoid excessive modal pop-ups or confusing navigation.
Intuitive UI: Utilize common mobile and web UI patterns. Ensure clear visual hierarchy and call-to-action buttons.
Feedback Mechanisms: Provide immediate, clear, and non-intrusive visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading indicators for async operations, success messages, error notifications).
Accessibility: Adhere to basic accessibility principles (e.g., sufficient color contrast, legible font sizes, appropriate touch target sizes for mobile, semantic HTML for web, ARIA attributes where needed).
Consistency: Maintain consistent UI elements, iconography, terminology, and navigation patterns across both the web and React Native applications.

4.5. Maintainability
Description: The codebase (Web and React Native) must be easy to understand, modify, extend, and debug over time, especially considering its AI-generated nature and the single human developer.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Clean Code Principles: Write concise, readable, self-documenting code. Avoid unnecessary complexity, deeply nested logic, or "magic numbers."
Comments: Provide clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date comments for complex logic, non-obvious implementations, function headers, and component purpose.
Consistent Styling: Strictly adhere to the defined Tailwind CSS utility classes and Shadcn UI components for web, and the adapted Tailwind/custom styling for React Native.
Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript consistently for all components, hooks, services, data models, and Convex schemas to enhance code clarity, catch errors early, and improve refactoring safety.
Modularity: Strictly follow the modular, feature-based architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
Code Conventions: Adhere to ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent code formatting.
Documentation: Ensure inline documentation is up-to-date and consistent with this SSD.

4.6. Reliability
Description: The application must perform its intended functions correctly and consistently under various operating conditions, including fluctuating network connectivity and varying device states.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Robust Error Handling: Implement comprehensive try-catch blocks for all asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls to Clerk/Convex).
Graceful Degradation: Design the application to gracefully handle temporary network disconnections, providing informative messages to the user rather than crashing or freezing. Re-establish connections and re-fetch data upon network recovery.
Edge Case Handling: Proactively consider and implement handling for edge cases as identified during the Human-in-the-Loop review process (e.g., empty states, invalid data, rate limiting).

4.7. Testability
Description: The application's components and features must be designed in a way that facilitates efficient and effective automated and manual testing.
Guidance for AI Agents:
Loose Coupling: Develop components and modules with minimal dependencies on each other, allowing for isolated testing.
Pure Functions: Favor pure functions where possible, which are easier to test.
Separation of Concerns: Ensure UI logic is separated from business logic and data fetching, improving testability.
Test-Friendly Structure: Structure components to accept props for data rather than relying heavily on global state for unit testing.
