# 8. Quality Assurance & Project Management

Given the unique "vibecoding" approach and the single human developer, project management and quality assurance are integrated into a continuous, iterative workflow with robust human oversight. This strategy ensures transparency, quality, and efficient iteration.

8.1. Human-in-the-Loop Workflow
You, as the central orchestrator, will manage the entire lifecycle of a feature for both the Web and ReactNative applications. This workflow emphasizes iterative refinement and critical human intervention.
Task Definition: Break down granular features and requirements from this SSD into small, actionable tasks (e.g., "Implement user sign-up page with Clerk," "Create a Convex function to handle new Whispers").
Prompt Engineering: Craft precise, detailed, and unambiguous prompts for the AI agents, including specific code structures, technologies, and integration points.
AI Code Generation: AI agents generate code and relevant assets (e.g., tests, documentation snippets) based on the provided prompts.
Human Review & Validation: This is the most critical step. You will meticulously review all AI-generated code for correctness, security vulnerabilities, performance optimization, adherence to architectural patterns, coding standards, and compliance with this SSD.
Integration: Integrate the validated and potentially corrected code into the respective application's codebase.
Testing: Perform thorough testing to ensure the new functionality works as expected and does not introduce regressions.
Documentation & Tracking: Update the Notion Kanban board and the AI Agent Logbook, capturing all details of the task's lifecycle.

8.2. Kanban-Based Project Tracking (Notion)
Tool: Notion will serve as the primary project management tool, leveraging its database capabilities for a dynamic Kanban board.
Kanban Board Structure: A dedicated Kanban board will be maintained for each production application (Web and ReactNative), with the following columns representing the workflow stages:
Backlog: Contains all defined features and tasks from this SSD awaiting implementation. These are prioritized by you.
To Do: Tasks that are prioritized and fully defined, ready to be prompted to an AI agent.
Vibecoding in Progress: Tasks that have been prompted to an AI agent, and code generation is underway.
Ready for Review: The AI agent has provided its code output, and the task is awaiting your meticulous human validation.
Testing: The code has been reviewed and validated (with any necessary human corrections) and is currently undergoing integration and functional testing within the application.
Done: The feature is fully implemented, thoroughly tested, integrated, and all associated documentation (SSD, AI Agent Logbook) has been updated.
Purpose: Provides transparent, visual progress tracking; enables flexible prioritization; and facilitates efficient management of the AI-driven workflow, ensuring a clear understanding of task status.

8.3. AI Agent "Logbook"
Mechanism: Each task card within the Notion Kanban board will double as a detailed AI Agent "Logbook" entry, providing a comprehensive audit trail.
Content for Each Card:
Task ID: A unique identifier for the task (e.g., automatically generated by Notion).
Application: (e.g., Web, ReactNative)
Feature Module: The specific feature module the task belongs to (e.g., authentication, whispers).
Requirement Reference: A direct link or explicit reference to the corresponding section/Requirement ID in this SSD.
AI Prompt: The exact, detailed prompt given to the AI agent for this task.
AI Output (Link/Snippet): A link to the AI-generated code (e.g., GitHub Gist, code hosted on a platform like Pastebin, or a directly embedded code snippet if small).
Human Review Notes: Detailed observations during your code review, including:
Identified issues (bugs, inefficiencies, security flaws).
Required corrections or refactorings.
Rationale for accepting or rejecting specific AI-generated code patterns.
Performance insights or optimizations applied.
Manual Adjustments: Any code modifications made by you (the human developer) after the initial AI generation. This includes fixes, refactorings, or enhancements not directly provided by the AI.
Status: Corresponds to the current Kanban board column (e.g., Ready for Review, Testing, Done).
Purpose: This logbook is paramount for maintaining traceability, accountability, and a comprehensive learning record in an AI-driven development environment. It provides an auditable history of how each piece of code was generated, reviewed, and integrated, which is critical for:
Debugging: Quickly identifying the source of issues.
Future Maintenance: Understanding design decisions and past modifications.
AI Training & Refinement: Learning about the AI's capabilities and limitations, informing future prompt engineering.
Compliance: Providing a verifiable record of development, if needed.

8.4. Code Review & Validation
Process: This is the most critical "Human-in-the-Loop" step. All AI-generated code, regardless of perceived simplicity, will undergo rigorous manual review by you.
Focus Areas during Review:
Functional Correctness: Does the code accurately implement the specified functionality?
Adherence to Specifications: Does the code align with the architectural patterns (modular, feature flags), data schemas (Convex), and non-functional requirements (performance, security) outlined in this SSD?
Security Vulnerabilities: Proactively identify and mitigate potential security flaws (e.g., improper input sanitization, insecure data handling, exposure of sensitive data).
Performance Optimization: Evaluate for inefficiencies, unnecessary re-renders, suboptimal algorithms, or excessive network requests.
Code Quality & Readability: Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and follows established conventions (e.g., TypeScript usage, ESLint rules, consistent variable naming).
Error Handling: Verify robust error handling mechanisms are in place for API calls, network issues, and unexpected states.
Feature Flag Integration: Ensure new features (deferred ones) are correctly wrapped in feature flags when applicable, and that flags are appropriately set (e.g., false for MVP).

8.5. Testing Strategy
Manual Testing (Primary): As the sole human developer, you will perform comprehensive manual testing for each feature upon its integration. This is the primary method of QA for the initial MVP.
Functional Testing: Verifying that each feature (e.g., user registration, sending a whisper) works as expected according to its user story and functional requirements.
Usability Testing: Ensuring the user flow is intuitive and meets the one-minute first-whisper target.
Performance Spot Checks: Basic qualitative checks for UI responsiveness (e.g., no noticeable jank) and application load times.
Regression Testing: Manually re-testing existing core functionalities to ensure new features do not introduce unintended side effects.
Cross-Platform Testing: Testing both Web (on multiple browsers/devices) and ReactNative (on Android and iOS simulators/devices).
Automated Testing (Future-Proofing): While not a primary focus for the initial vibecoded MVP due to resource constraints, the architecture will be designed to support the future integration of automated tests.
Unit Tests: For individual functions, utility helpers, and isolated components.
Integration Tests: For verifying interactions between different modules or between client and backend (Convex).
End-to-End (E2E) Tests: For simulating full user flows (e.g., sign up -> send whisper -> receive whisper).
Guidance for AI Agents: AI agents will be encouraged to generate basic unit tests alongside the functional code where feasible, to accelerate the future adoption of automated testing. These tests will also undergo human review.

8.6. Version Control (Git)
Repository Structure: The entire EchoinWhispr project (containing Web, ReactNative, and Flutter subfolders) will be managed under a single Git repository on GitHub.
Branching Strategy: A simplified branching strategy will be employed:
main branch: Represents the stable, production-ready codebase. All deployments will originate from this branch.
development branch: All integrated features will first land here after review and testing.
Feature branches: Each task or feature development will occur on a dedicated feature branch, branching off development.
Commit Messages: Clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages are mandatory. Each commit message should ideally reference the Notion task ID it relates to (e.g., FEAT-RN-001: Implement user registration UI).
