This document provides detailed, tailored instructions and guidance for AI agents to support the human developer in building the Flutter application of the EchoinWhispr project. It distills requirements from the EchoinWhispr: General Software Specification Document (SSD) but adapts them for a personal learning project. The primary purpose here is to guide the human developer through Flutter best practices, architectural patterns, and integrations, serving as a comprehensive learning resource rather than a direct code generation mandate.
